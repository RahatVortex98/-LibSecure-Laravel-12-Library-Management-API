Hiring Manager
Wizard Software & Technology Bangladesh Ltd.
Level-9, F Haque Tower, Bir Uttam C R Datta Road
Dhaka - 1205, Bangladesh
Dear Hiring Manager,
I am excited to apply for the Junior PHP-Laravel Developer position at Wizard Software & Technology Bangladesh Ltd., as advertised. I have a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science & Engineering from United International University and hands-on experience building web applications using PHP and Laravel. I look forward to contributing to your team by developing efficient and maintainable solutions. My passion for coding, along with my ability to collaborate and learn quickly, makes me eager to grow within your team at WiztecBD.

In my role as Backend Developer at Noetic IT, I improved REST APIs to reduce response times, optimized PostgreSQL queries for better efficiency, and implemented secure authentication using JWT and OAuth. I also introduced Docker for streamlined deployments. My focus on clean and scalable code aligns with your needs for designing, developing, and maintaining Laravel-based applications. Additionally, as a Part-Time Web Assistant at PaperArt, I customized HTML, CSS, and JavaScript templates, resolved frontend issues to improve load speeds, and collaborated with senior developers, which helped me hone my troubleshooting and teamwork skills.

My expertise in Laravel stands out in my personal projects, where I've built full-stack applications from scratch. For instance, I developed the HR Management System (HRMS) using Laravel, PHP, and MySQL. This system includes role-based access control, CRUD operations for personnel data, leave management, payroll, and a dynamic admin dashboard and employee portal using Blade and Bootstrap. This project streamlined HR operations and emphasized real-time tracking: https://github.com/RahatVortex98/HR-Management-System-HRMS.

Similarly, in MedConnect, a healthcare appointment platform built with Laravel, PHP, and MySQL, I implemented secure patient management, doctor profiles, and an admin dashboard secured with RBAC for handling appointments with real-time status updates (Approve/Cancel). The responsive user portal was designed with Blade, HTML, CSS, and WoW.js, ensuring efficient workflows: https://github.com/RahatVortex98/MedConnect.

I also created LaraStock Manager, an inventory system using Laravel 12, MySQL, and Tailwind CSS. This system features real-time stock tracking, transactions, and CRUD operations for suppliers and customers, demonstrating my ability to deliver modular and high-performing applications: https://github.com/RahatVortex98/LaraStock-Manager.

These experiences have given me strong problem-solving skills and a commitment to good practices, including code reviews and staying updated with PHP and Laravel advancements. I am particularly attracted to WiztecBD's focus on mentorship and training, as I do well in environments that encourage growth and innovation.

I would appreciate the chance to discuss how my background can support your team's projects. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to contribute to Wizard Software & Technology Bangladesh Ltd.
Sincerely,
MD. RAISUL ISLAM
